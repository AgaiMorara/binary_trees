0x1D. C - Binary trees
The Binary Tree datastructure implementation.
Modular implement
	0.) Creates a binary tree node
	1.) Inserts a node as the left child of another node
	2.) Inserts a node as the right child of another node
	3.) Deletes an entire binary tree
	4.) Checks if a node is a leaf
	5.) Checks if a node is a root
	6.) Goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
	7.) Goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
	8.)Goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
	9.) Measures the height of a binary tree
	10.)Measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
	11.) Measures the size of a binary tree
	12.) Counts the leaves in a binary tree
	13.) Counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
	14.) Measures the balance factor of a binary tree
	15.) Checks if a binary tree is full
	16.) Checks if a binary tree is perfect
	17.) Finds the sibling of a node
	18.) Finds the uncle of a node
